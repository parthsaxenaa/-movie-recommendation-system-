## Overview
This is a simple movie recommendation system that takes two inputs from the user: genre of the movie and number of recommendations desired, and provides the output in the form of a table.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the `movie_recommendation.py` script:
    ```
    python movie_recommendation.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts to input the genre of the movie and the number of recommendations desired.
5. The system will generate a table displaying the recommended movies based on the inputs provided.
